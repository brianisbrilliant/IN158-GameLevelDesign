ClassNotesHowToTeach
	it's a good idea to ask particular students instead of waiting for 
		them to offer the information.
	i would ask, ask nicely, and then deduct participation credit from 
	that day. 
		after the class i would talk to them and explain that 
	they are here not only to learn to script, but to become a 
	successful person, to mesh well into a team, and that is what i 
	am going to push them to learn.

	what to talk about in the syllabus:
		this is a contract between me and you, this outlines what i expect from you, 
		and what you can expect from me.
		what i expect from you: to read the book BEFORE class, and do the assignments BEFORE class.
			scripting can take more than one take to understand, and if you've tried to puzzle out what is happening before i talk about it, you will understand much better what i am telling you. your grades will be affected by your ability to understand the material.


notes on the book: $65 in the book store, $45 on amazon(plus shipping), $30 on Packt(as an eBook).
	is it frowned upon to tell my students where to get the book cheapest?

	can i make the homework due the day i talk about it in class? no, probably not.
		but i will emphasize the benefits of being a week ahead with your homework.
